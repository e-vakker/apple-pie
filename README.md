# Apple Pie
 Project for IPad from "Develop in Swift Fundamentals". 
 
 In this simple word-guessing game, each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.

## Tasks
- [ ] Build the Interface 
- [ ] Beginning a Game
- [ ] Update Game State
- [ ] Create Revealed Word
- [ ] Handle a Win or Loss
## Additional tasks
- [ ] Learn about the map method, and use it in place of the loop that converts the array of characters to an array of strings in updateUI()
- [ ] Add a scoring feature that awards points for each correct guess and additional points for each successful word completion.
- [ ] Allow multiple players to play, switching turns after each incorrect guess
- [ ] Allow the player to guess the full word using the keyboard instead of guessing one letter at a time using the interface buttons.
- [ ] Support letters with special characters. For example, the E button could check for “e” and “é” within a word.
- [ ] The keyboard layout doesn’t work well when the app is in one-third Split View mode on iPad—the buttons get flattened. To resolve this issue, use trait variations to adjust the layout when in compact width.
