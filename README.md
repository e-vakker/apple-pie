# Apple Pie
 Project for IPad from "Develop in Swift Fundamentals". 
 
 In this simple word-guessing game, each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone. In this version you have to guess the countries of the European continent.

## Tasks
- [X] Build the Interface 
- [X] Beginning a Game
- [X] Update Game State
- [X] Create Revealed Word
- [X] Handle a Win or Loss
## Additional tasks
- [X] Learn about the map method, and use it in place of the loop that converts the array of characters to an array of strings in updateUI()
- [X] Add a scoring feature that awards points for each correct guess and additional points for each successful word completion.
- [X] Allow multiple players to play, switching turns after each incorrect guess
- [ ] Allow the player to guess the full word using the keyboard instead of guessing one letter at a time using the interface buttons.
- [ ] Support letters with special characters. For example, the E button could check for “e” and “é” within a word.
- [X] The keyboard layout doesn’t work well when the app is in one-third Split View mode on iPad—the buttons get flattened. To resolve this issue, use trait variations to adjust the layout when in compact width.
